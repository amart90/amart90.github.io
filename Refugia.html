								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>The Northern Spotted Owl (<i>Strix occidentalis caurina</i>) is a threatened species that is reliant on the old growth forest of the Pacific Northwest. 
									There is evidence that their habitat has been decreasing over the last 25 years and that wildfire is the primary cause. 
									One way to help promote spotted owl habitat is to prioritize high value fire refugia within fire perimeters. 
									To accomplish this, a fire refugia ranking model was created to assess the importance of fire refugia for spotted owl nesting/roosting habitat.</p>
								<h2>Multi-criteria Decision Analysis Model</h2>
								<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Model2.png" alt="" /></span></div>
								<p>The model uses a multiple criteria analysis (MCDA) system called the Environmental Evaluation Modeling System (EEMS; <a href="https://consbio.org/products/publications/platform-independent-fuzzy-logic-modeling-framework-environmental-decision-support">Sheehan & Gough, 2016</a>). 
									EEMS is a platform-independent fuzzy logic MCDA modeling framework, developed specifically to provide environmental decision support. 
									It works by evaluating the degree of truth or falseness of hierarchically arranged propositions, linked and combined with operators (AND, OR, etc.).</p>
								<p>For this model, the final proposition to be evaluated for each unburned island with the given fire perimeter is “<i>this unburned island is important for spotted owl habitat</i>.” 
									The degree of truth of that proposition is evaluated from a combination of the following: (1) “<i>the area within this refugia is important for spotted owls</i>” and (2) “<i>the area surrounding this refugia is important to spotted owls</i>.” 
									Those propositions are then determined using a suite of input datasets.</p>
								<h2>More Information</h2>
								<p>This model was developed for Chapter 4 of my thesis, "Characterizing and Ranking the Importance of Fire Refugia in the Northwestern US" (<a href="files/Thesis.pdf">Martinez, 2019</a>).</p>
								<p>It was later refined and published as Assessing the quality of fire refugia for wildlife habitat (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118868">Andrus et al., 2021</a>).</p>
								<p>The code can be viewed at <a href="https://github.com/amart90/FireRefugiaRanking">GitHub</a> and includes the code for all the graphs seen in Chapter 4 of my thesis.</p>
